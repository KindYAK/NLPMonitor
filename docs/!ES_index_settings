If index.max_result_window error occurs (maximum number of documents in one request), change index.max_result_windows in your index settings through Kibana (5601)


Q: I want to turn off index on certain fields
A:
1) You must specify this on mapping, as the default behavior of the elastic is to index as much as he can
2) You must specify this it in `dynamic mapping`. When dynamic mapping is on creation time, you can easily modify it.
Via type, field_name, path_name.
Example:
{
    "not_indexed_long": {
        "match_mapping_type": "long",
        "mapping": {
            "type": "long",
            "index": False
        }
    }
}  -> all long values would not index in elastic
